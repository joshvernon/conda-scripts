# conda-scripts
Utility scripts that mostly piggyback off of [conda-api] (https://github.com/conda/conda-api).  
These scripts may or may not be useful to anyone. "It works on *my* machine".

### Dependencies  
The latest version of [conda-api] (https://github.com/conda/conda-api). Right now this means the package must be cloned from GitHub and [locally built] (http://conda.pydata.org/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs2.html) and installed in your root conda environment.
